nmcli list connections show active
The correct command to show active network connections using nmcli is:
bash
nmcli connection show --active
Use code with caution.

 
Key Details:
Abbreviations: You can use shorter versions of the command for faster typing:
nmcli con show --active
nmcli con show -a
nmcli c s -a
Output: This command displays a table listing the NAME, UUID, TYPE, and DEVICE for all currently active connection profiles.
Difference from nmcli connection show: Without the --active flag, the command lists all configured connection profiles, whether they are currently in use or not.
Alternative Status Check: To see the status of network devices (interfaces) rather than the connection profiles, use:
bash
nmcli device status
Use code with caution.

in nmcli i want to show which wifi router of my eero network i'm connected to, and see what the signal strength is as a percentage
To see which specific eero node you are connected to and its signal strength using nmcli, you can use the device wifi command with custom fields. 
Commands to View Connection Details
Show current connection only:
To see just the active access point, its BSSID (MAC address), and signal strength percentage, run:
bash
nmcli -f IN-USE,BSSID,SSID,SIGNAL device wifi | grep '*'
Use code with caution.

Show all nearby nodes (detailed list):
If you want to see all your eero nodes and compare their signal strengths:
bash
nmcli -f IN-USE,BSSID,SSID,SIGNAL,BARS device wifi
Use code with caution.

 
Identifying Your eero Node
Since eero networks typically use the same SSID (network name) for every node, you must look at the BSSID column. 
BSSID: This is the unique MAC address of the specific radio on the eero node you are currently talking to.
SIGNAL: This column displays the signal strength as a percentage (0-100). 
Limitations for 2026
While nmcli provides the hardware address (BSSID), it does not show the "friendly name" you gave the node in the eero app (e.g., "Living Room eero"). To map a BSSID to a specific room, you may need to check the eero App under the "Devices" tab, where you can match the MAC address to the node name.

it seems to be connecting to an eero node in my network that is far from being the strongest signal. how do i make it reconnect to the one with the strongest signal. seems it should be automatic.
While mesh systems like eero are designed to handle this automatically through "Client Steering," the decision to switch (roam) is ultimately made by your device's WiFi driver. Linux often "clings" to a weak signal because the threshold to trigger a new search hasn't been met. 
1. Manual Reconnect to the Best Node 
To force an immediate reconnection to the strongest available eero node, you can trigger a rescan and then tell nmcli to connect to the specific BSSID (MAC address) of the node with the best signal. 
Find the BSSID of the strongest node:
bash
nmcli -f IN-USE,BSSID,SIGNAL,SSID device wifi list | grep "Your_SSID_Name"
Use code with caution.

Connect directly to that BSSID:
Identify the BSSID (e.g., AA:BB:CC:11:22:33) with the highest signal percentage and run:
bash
nmcli device wifi connect AA:BB:CC:11:22:33
Use code with caution.

 
2. Force a Fresh Scan & Auto-Selection
If you don't want to specify a BSSID, you can force the system to drop the current weak connection and re-evaluate all nodes. It will typically pick the strongest one during the handshake. 
bash
nmcli device wifi rescan && nmcli device wifi connect "Your_SSID_Name"
Use code with caution.

3. Improving Automatic "Roaming"
To make this process more automatic in the future, check these settings:
Enable Client Steering: In the eero app, ensure "Client Steering" (found under Settings > Network Settings) is turned ON. This allows eero to actively encourage your device to move to a better node.
Toggle WiFi: Often, simply cycling the interface is enough to trigger a roam to the nearest node:
bash
nmcli radio wifi off && nmcli radio wifi on
Use code with caution.

BSSID Locking (Caution): You can technically "lock" your device to a specific eero node by setting the 802-11-wireless.bssid property in your connection profile. However, this is generally discouraged for laptops, as you will lose connectivity entirely when you move to another room. 
Summary of Commands
Action 	Command
List Strengths	nmcli -f BSSID,SIGNAL,SSID device wifi list
Force Best Node	nmcli device wifi connect <BSSID_OF_STRONGEST>
Quick Reset	nmcli radio wifi off && nmcli radio wifi on

where is it remembering which network to join? where is the list? some connection profile?
In Linux, NetworkManager stores your saved Wi-Fi networks as Connection Profiles. These are simple text files that contain the SSID, security keys, and auto-connect settings.
1. Where the files are stored
On most distributions, these profiles are stored in a protected system directory:
Path: /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/
Access: You need sudo (root) permissions to view them because they contain your Wi-Fi passwords in plain text or encrypted form.
2. How to list them via command line
You can view the list of saved profiles using nmcli:
bash
nmcli connection show
Use code with caution.

This list includes all saved networks, not just the active one.
3. How to view the details of a specific profile
If you want to see the specific settings for your eero network (such as whether it is set to auto-connect or if it is locked to a specific BSSID), run:
bash
nmcli connection show "Your_SSID_Name"
Use code with caution.

4. How the "Auto-Connect" logic works
NetworkManager uses a specific property to decide whether to join a network automatically. You can check the priority of your networks with this command:
bash
nmcli -f NAME,UUID,AUTOCONNECT,AUTOCONNECT-PRIORITY connection show
Use code with caution.

AUTOCONNECT: If this is yes, the system will attempt to join this network whenever it is in range.
AUTOCONNECT-PRIORITY: If you have multiple saved networks in the same area, NetworkManager will pick the one with the higher number.
5. Managing the List
To prevent a network from auto-connecting:
nmcli connection modify "Your_SSID_Name" connection.autoconnect no
To "forget" (delete) a network:
nmcli connection delete "Your_SSID_Name"
For more detailed technical documentation on how these profiles are structured, you can refer to the NetworkManager Project Documentation.



my network name is "bugger's kingdom". sadly i set it up with an apostrophe. this causes it to have trouble recognizing it. in particular nmcli device wifi connect "bugger's kingom" doesn't work. i've tried all variants with escape sequences, but nothing works. suggestions?
To connect to an SSID containing an apostrophe, you must navigate the "double parsing" of both the Linux shell (Bash/ZSH) and the nmcli internal parser.
Since single quotes ' and double quotes " are often consumed by the shell before nmcli sees them, the most reliable methods in 2026 are:
1. Use the BSSID (Recommended)
The easiest way to bypass naming issues entirely is to connect using the MAC address of the eero node. This avoids all character escaping problems.
Find the BSSID for your network:
nmcli device wifi list | grep "bugger's kingdom"
Connect using that BSSID:
nmcli device wifi connect AA:BB:CC:11:22:33
2. Double-Quote + Backslash Escape
If you want to use the name, you must wrap the entire string in double quotes and use a backslash to escape the apostrophe so the shell doesn't interpret it as the start of a single-quoted string.
bash
nmcli device wifi connect "bugger\'s kingdom"
Use code with caution.

3. Use the Hex-Encoded SSID
If your terminal continues to struggle with the character, you can provide the SSID in hex format. You can find the hex string by running:
bash
nmcli -f SSID-HEX,SSID device wifi list
Use code with caution.

Then connect using the hex string (no quotes needed):
bash
nmcli device wifi connect 6275676765722773206b696e67646f6d
Use code with caution.

4. Interactive Connection
If the command line arguments are failing, use the interactive nmcli prompt. This bypasses shell argument parsing entirely:
Type nmcli to enter the tool.
Type dev wifi connect "bugger's kingdom" inside the prompt.
5. Cleaning up the Saved Profile
If you have an old, broken profile saved, it might be conflicting. Check your existing profiles and delete any that look incorrect:
bash
nmcli connection show
nmcli connection delete "bugger's kingdom"
Use code with caution.

For more troubleshooting on SSID naming conventions, the NetworkManager Manual provides a full list of character escape sequences supported by the utility.



when i use the ssid-hex, it says Parameter <thingigaveit> is neither SSID nor BSSID
In 2026, nmcli handles hex inputs strictly. When you provide the hex-encoded SSID, you must explicitly prefix it with hex: so the parser knows it is not a literal string.
Run the command as follows:
bash
nmcli device wifi connect hex:6275676765722773206b696e67646f6d
Use code with caution.

Why your previous attempt failed:
Ambiguity: Without the hex: prefix, nmcli treats the long string of numbers and letters as a literal SSID name. Since no network is literally named "6275676...", it fails.
The Apostrophe: By using the hex: prefix, you are passing the raw data to the network card, bypassing the shell's confusion over the apostrophe in "bugger's kingdom".
If you still get an error:
Verify the Hex: Ensure you have the exact hex string from your specific environment, as small differences in spacing or hidden characters in the SSID can change the hex. Get it fresh with:
bash
nmcli -f SSID-HEX,SSID device wifi list | grep "bugger"
Use code with caution.

Rescan: Sometimes the BSSID cache is stale. Force a refresh before connecting:
bash
nmcli device wifi rescan
Use code with caution.

For further details on how NetworkManager handles special character encoding, you can consult the NetworkManager.conf documentation.

What do the fields in `nmcli device wifi list` mean?

What are the benefits of using a mesh WiFi system like eero?
same. now it says Parameter 'hex:thingigaveit' is neither SSID nor BSSID
If nmcli is refusing the hex: prefix, it typically means your version of the tool expects the raw hex string directly but is failing because it's interpreting the string as a literal name rather than a hex-encoded SSID.
To solve this for "bugger's kingdom" in 2026, use Method 1, which completely bypasses the SSID name.
Method 1: The "Bulletproof" BSSID Method
The BSSID is the hardware MAC address of the eero node. It has no special characters and never fails due to parsing errors.
Find the BSSID for your network (it will look like AA:BB:CC:11:22:33):
bash
nmcli -f BSSID,SIGNAL,SSID device wifi list | grep "bugger"
Use code with caution.

Connect directly to that BSSID:
bash
nmcli device wifi connect AA:BB:CC:11:22:33
Use code with caution.

Method 2: Manual Profile Creation
If the device wifi connect command keeps failing because of the apostrophe, you can manually create a connection profile. This defines the SSID exactly as it should be in the configuration file. 
Run this command (replace YOUR_PASSWORD with your actual Wi-Fi password): 
bash
nmcli connection add type wifi ifname wlan0 con-name "eero-home" ssid "bugger's kingdom" -- wifi-sec.key-mgmt wpa-psk wifi-sec.psk "YOUR_PASSWORD"
Use code with caution.

Note: We use con-name "eero-home" to give the profile a simple nickname that doesn't have an apostrophe, making it easy to manage later.
Once added, bring it up:
bash
nmcli connection up eero-home
Use code with caution.

Method 3: Use the TUI (Graphical-ish)
If the command line is still fighting you, use the built-in text user interface. It handles special characters and escaping automatically:
Run: nmtui
Select "Activate a connection".
Find bugger's kingdom in the list and press Enter.
Enter your password when prompted. 
Summary for 2026
Avoid using hex if the hex: prefix is being rejected; your specific nmcli build may have different SSID-HEX handling.
BSSID connection is the most reliable way to handle eero mesh nodes specifically, as it also allows you to pick the strongest node manually.
Ensure Client Steering is enabled in your eero app to help your device roam better in the future.

problem with the bssid method is that it likely connects to a weaker node than is available.
To solve the "weaker node" problem while still bypassing the apostrophe issue, you should use the BSSID method but target only the strongest node. In a mesh system like eero, each node has its own unique BSSID, even though they share the same SSID name.
1. Identify the Strongest eero Node
Run this command to see all eero nodes, sorted by signal strength (highest at the top):
bash
nmcli -f SIGNAL,BSSID,SSID device wifi list --rescan yes | sort -rn
Use code with caution.

2. Connect to the Top BSSID
Look at the top line where the SSID is bugger's kingdom. Take that specific BSSID (e.g., 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E) and connect:
bash
nmcli device wifi connect 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E
Use code with caution.

Because you are using a hardware MAC address (BSSID), nmcli will not look at the SSID name at all, completely avoiding the apostrophe error.
3. Make it Automatic (The "Signal Threshold" Fix)
If your Linux device keeps "sticking" to a weak node as you move around, you can configure the connection profile to be more aggressive. First, find your profile name (usually bugger's kingdom or what you named it in nmtui):
bash
nmcli connection show
Use code with caution.

Then, set a Background Scan Threshold. This tells NetworkManager to look for a better node if the current signal drops below a certain percentage (e.g., 65%):
bash
nmcli connection modify "bugger's kingdom" 802-11-wireless.powersave 2
nmcli connection modify "bugger's kingdom" 802-11-wireless.bgscan-threshold 65
Use code with caution.

4. Use the eero App to Confirm
To verify you are now on the correct node, check the eero App. It will show your device's current connection status and which specific eero it is talking to. If the app shows a "Great" connection but your Linux signal is low, ensure Client Steering is toggled ON in the eero app settings.
