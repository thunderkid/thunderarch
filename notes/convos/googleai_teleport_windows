i want a workflow on linux that's fast, keyboard focused, and efficient. i'm currently using hyprland. 3 monitors on desktop. when i do much typing on my side monitors, it's awkward after a bit. i'd like to be able to quickly teleport my active window to the center of the center monitor, *leaving a placeholder there - or ideally a copy of the active window* so other windows don't shift around. this is purely for typing convenience. then when i'm done, i'd like to be able to easily teleport it back. how can i achieve this?
To achieve a fast, keyboard-focused workflow that brings windows to your center monitor without disrupting your side-monitor layouts, you can use a custom script leveraging hyprctl. 
Since Hyprland doesn't have a native "placeholder" window, the most efficient method is to float the active window and teleport it to the center monitor. This keeps the original tiling slot "reserved" in the background so other windows don't shift. 
The "Teleport & Return" Workflow
This approach allows you to "summon" any window to your center view for typing and "dismiss" it back to its original location when finished.
1. Create the Teleport Script
Create a script (e.g., ~/.config/hypr/scripts/teleport.sh) that toggles the window state. 
bash
#!/bin/bash
# Get active window address and its current monitor
WINDOW_ADDR=$(hyprctl activewindow -j | jq -r '.address')
IS_FLOATING=$(hyprctl activewindow -j | jq -r '.floating')

if [ "$IS_FLOATING" = "false" ]; then
    # 1. Teleport to Center: Float it, move to center monitor, and center it
    # Replace 'DP-1' with your center monitor's name (check 'hyprctl monitors')
    hyprctl dispatch togglefloating address:$WINDOW_ADDR
    hyprctl dispatch movewindowmon address:$WINDOW_ADDR DP-1 
    hyprctl dispatch centerwindow 1
    # Optional: Resize for comfortable typing
    hyprctl dispatch resizeactive exact 1200 800
else
    # 2. Return to Original: Unfloat it (it will snap back to its previous tiling slot)
    hyprctl dispatch togglefloating address:$WINDOW_ADDR
fi
Use code with caution.

Why this works: When you toggle a window to floating in Hyprland, it technically stays assigned to its original tiling position in the layout. Toggling it back to "tiled" (togglefloating again) snaps it back exactly where it was. 
2. Bind the Action
Add a keybinding in your hyprland.conf to trigger the script: 
bash
# Example: Super + Shift + T to teleport
bind = $mainMod SHIFT, T, exec, ~/.config/hypr/scripts/teleport.sh
Use code with caution.

Alternatives for "Placeholder" Behavior
If you prefer a visual "copy" or absolute layout stability:
The Scratchpad (Special Workspace): Move the window to a Special Workspace (movetoworkspace, special). This hides it completely, but if it was the only window on a side monitor, that monitor will become empty instead of shifting.
Swap Instead of Move: Use swapwindow to swap the active window with whatever is currently in the center of your main monitor. This is better if you always want something on your side monitors. 
Efficiency Tips
Identify Monitor Names: Run hyprctl monitors to get the exact string (like HDMI-A-1 or DP-1) for your center screen.
Automatic Centering: Use the windowrule center to ensure any window you float manually is automatically positioned in the middle. 
These guides demonstrate how to float and center windows on your main monitor to create a typing-friendly zone without disrupting your other displays:

i'm trying to  understand hyprctl. when i say hyprctl activewindow
i get Window 5538331bb490 -> myname@mycomputer:~:
etc
but then hyprctl dispatch togglefloating address:55e8331bb490 says window not found
The reason your command is failing is that hyprctl requires addresses to be prefixed with 0x to be recognized as hexadecimals. 
When you run hyprctl activewindow, it displays the raw hex address (e.g., 5538331bb490). However, the dispatch command interprets that raw number incorrectly unless you explicitly tell it it's a hex address. 
Correct Syntax
To toggle floating using an address, use this format: 
bash
hyprctl dispatch togglefloating address:0x5538331bb490
Use code with caution.

Pro-Tip: Automated Address Handling
If you are writing scripts, you can use the -j (JSON) flag with jq to automatically grab the correctly formatted address:
The Manual Way: Add 0x to whatever hyprctl activewindow gives you.
The Scripting Way: Use this command to get the address of the currently active window and toggle its floating state immediately:
bash
hyprctl dispatch togglefloating address:0x$(hyprctl activewindow -j | jq -r '.address')
Use code with caution.

Why "Window not found" happens:
Missing Prefix: Without 0x, Hyprland might try to parse the string as a decimal or a different window identifier (like a title or class).
Typo in Address: Ensure you are copying the full hex string. Note that in your example, you provided 5538331bb490 but then tried to call 55e8331bb490 (a subtle 'e' instead of '3'); using the 0x$(...) subshell method above eliminates this risk. 
These technical guides explain how to correctly format window addresses for "hyprctl" commands and how to automatically extract them for scripting:
