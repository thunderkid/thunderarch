give me a very simple kbd file for testing kanata on arch linux

Testing out Kanata on Arch is a great move—it’s easily the most responsive remapper out there. Since you want something simple to verify it's working, we’ll set up a "Caps Lock to Escape/Control" hybrid (tap for Esc, hold for Ctrl) and a simple layer toggle.

1. The Configuration (test.kbd)
Create a file named test.kbd. This configuration does three things:

Defines your physical keys (defsrc).

Creates a "Home" layer with a multi-purpose Caps Lock.

Adds a "Utility" layer to prove layer switching works.

Lisp
;; Simple Kanata test config

(defsrc
  caps a s d
)

(defalias
  ;; tap-hold: tap for escape, hold for leftcontrol
  capsw (tap-hold 200 200 esc lctl)
  
  ;; layer toggle: hold 'a' to activate the 'utility' layer
  util (layer-toggle utility)
)

(deflayer default
  @capsw @util s d
)

(deflayer utility
  _      _    up down
)
2. How to Test It
Before committing to a systemd service, run it directly in your terminal to catch errors.

Check Permissions: Ensure your user is in the input and uinput groups: sudo usermod -aG input,uinput $USER (You may need to log out and back in).

Run Kanata:

Bash
kanata --config test.kbd
The "Success" Checklist:

Tap Caps Lock: Does it act like Esc?

Hold Caps Lock + T: Does it act like Ctrl + T (new tab)?

Hold 'a' and press 's' or 'd': Do they act like Up and Down arrows?

Quick Troubleshooting
Device Not Found: If Kanata can't find your keyboard, you might need to specify the device path using the --path flag, though on Arch, it usually auto-detects well.

Interception: If you get an error about "interception," make sure no other remappers (like dual-function-keys or interception-tools) are running.

Would you like me to show you how to set this up as a systemd user service so it starts automatically when you log in?

get error that there's no uinput group

Ah, the classic Arch "no group" hurdle. Since Arch is a "do it yourself" distro, it doesn't create the uinput group by default—you have to create it and then tell the system that the /dev/uinput device belongs to that group.

Heads up: Due to a recent change in systemd (v258+), udev now ignores non-system groups. We need to make sure we create it as a system group.

Here is the fix, step-by-step:

1. Create the Group and Add Yourself
Run these commands to create the group properly and add your user to it.

Bash
# Create a system group (-r) for uinput
sudo groupadd -r uinput

# Add your user to both input and uinput groups
sudo usermod -aG input,uinput $USER
2. Set the Permissions (udev Rule)
Now we need to tell Linux that whenever the uinput device is created, it should be accessible by that group. Create a new udev rule file:

Bash
echo 'KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="uinput", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-uinput.rules
3. Load the Module & Apply Rules
To make it work right now without a reboot:

Bash
# Force the uinput module to load
sudo modprobe uinput

# Reload udev to apply the new group/mode settings
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
4. The Final "Secret Sauce"
Even after doing the above, your current terminal session doesn't know you're in the new group yet. To avoid logging out and back in, run this to refresh your groups in the current shell:

Bash
newgrp uinput
Now try running Kanata again:
Bash
kanata --config test.kbd
Is it still giving you a "Permission Denied" error? If so, run ls -l /dev/uinput. You should see something like:

crw-rw---- 1 root uinput ... /dev/uinput

If you see that, but Kanata still fails, a quick reboot is the cleanest way to ensure all groups and udev rules are fully synced across the whole system.

Would you like me to help you set up a systemd service next so you don't have to keep a terminal window open?

FATAL: Module uinput not found in directory /lib/modules/6.18.6-arch1-1

That error is a classic Arch Linux signal that your running kernel and your installed kernel are out of sync.

On Arch, when you run a system update (pacman -Syu), the kernel is updated on disk, and the modules for the old kernel are often deleted. If you haven't rebooted since your last update, the system is looking for drivers (like uinput) for a kernel version that effectively no longer exists in /lib/modules/.

The Fix: Reboot
The immediate solution is to reboot your computer. This will load the new kernel version that actually matches the files currently on your disk.

Why this happens (and how to prevent it)
When you update the kernel on Arch, the old modules are removed immediately. If you try to load a "new" module (like uinput) before rebooting, the system looks in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/, but that folder was deleted or replaced during the update.

To verify this is the issue, run:

Bash
uname -r           # Check running kernel version
ls /lib/modules/   # Check installed kernel versions
If the numbers don't match, you're living in the "ghost" of a previous kernel.

Pro-Tip for Arch Users
If you hate having to reboot immediately after a kernel update just to load a module, you can install the kernel-modules-hook package from the AUR. It keeps the old modules around until the next successful boot so you don't run into this "Module not found" error.

Once you've rebooted, try the command again:

Bash
sudo modprobe uinput
kanata --config test.kbd
Would you like me to wait while you reboot, or shall we move on to setting up the auto-load for that module?

should i be getting this? seems the current running version is 18.6 but the library versions are 18.7. How is the running version a later version? does this make sense? seems out of whack with what you said.

[adrian@macbookarch convos]$ uname -r

6.18.6-arch1-1

[adrian@macbookarch convos]$ ls /lib/modules

6.18.7-arch1-1

[adrian@macbookarch convos]$

Actually, that exactly matches what I described—your running kernel is older than what is on the disk.

Your running kernel: 6.18.6 (This is the "old" one you booted into).

Your library version: 6.18.7 (This is the "new" one installed during your last update).

On Arch, 6.18.7 is the later (newer) version. In software versioning, the numbers after the dots are treated as integers, not decimals. So, .7 comes after .6.

Why it feels "out of whack"
When you ran pacman -Syu, Arch downloaded kernel 6.18.7 and deleted the folder for 6.18.6. Since you haven't rebooted yet, your CPU is still running the instructions for 6.18.6, but when you ask for a module (like uinput), the system looks for the folder /lib/modules/6.18.6/.

Because that folder was deleted during the update to 6.18.7, you get the FATAL: Module not found error. The system literally cannot find the drivers for the kernel you are currently using.

The Fix
You just need to reboot.

Once you reboot:

Your system will start using kernel 6.18.7.

uname -r will return 6.18.7.

The system will be able to find /lib/modules/6.18.7/ and load uinput without a problem.

Would you like me to provide the command to make sure the uinput module loads automatically every time you boot up after this?

ok. so i'll reboot, then do what exactly? i'd like kanata just to work at that point

Once you reboot, your kernel and modules will be in sync. To make sure Kanata "just works" without you having to manually modprobe or use sudo every time, follow these three final steps:

1. Ensure the module loads on boot
Since uinput isn't always loaded by default, tell Arch to load it at startup:

Bash
echo "uinput" | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf
2. Verify your Group Membership
Since you already ran the usermod commands, they will take effect the moment you log back in after the reboot. You can verify you are "officially" in the groups by running:

Bash
groups
(You should see input and uinput in the list).

3. Run Kanata
Once you're back at your desktop, open a terminal and run your test:

Bash
kanata --config test.kbd
The "Permanent" Solution (Systemd)
If the test works and you like the layout, you won't want to keep a terminal window open forever. You can let Arch manage Kanata in the background.

Move your config to a standard location:

Bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/kanata
mv test.kbd ~/.config/kanata/kanata.kbd
Create a User Service: Create this file at ~/.config/systemd/user/kanata.service:

Ini, TOML
[Unit]
Description=Kanata keyboard remapper
Documentation=https://github.com/jtroo/kanata

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/kanata --config %h/.config/kanata/kanata.kbd
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
Enable it:

Bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now kanata
Now it will start automatically every time you log in. Go ahead and reboot—would you like me to give you a more advanced "Home Row Mods" configuration once you're back up and running?
