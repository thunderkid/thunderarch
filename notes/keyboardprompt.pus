try mapping Caps Lock to a "dual-role" key: Esc when tapped, and Ctrl (or a Layer toggle) when held. It’s a life-changer for laptop ergonomics.

On a standard keyboard, Space is just a big, dumb bar. With Kanata, you turn it into a dual-role key.
If you press and release Space within a certain time limit (e.g., 200ms), it sends a standard space character.
